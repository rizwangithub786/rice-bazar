# RiceBazar PWA (Scaffold)

This is a minimal scaffold of the RiceBazar Progressive Web App using:
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- React Router

How to use:
1. Extract the zip.
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn`).
3. Run `npm run dev` to start development (localhost:3000).

Notes:
- This scaffold includes UI for the home page, navigation drawer, and basic pages.
- Replace placeholders and add integrations (Supabase, payments, PWA service worker) as needed.
